# CortWeatherApp
CortWeatherApp is a weather website using Frontend technology .
It's a fully responsive html/css/javascript webapp with fetched API data.
You will get to know the temperature , time , date , day  also the weather details of 
that location (cloud% , Humidity% , Wind speed). 
I have added several background and icons ,depending on the weather conditions . Search the location and press enter , it will show you the results. If the entered location is not present in the fetched api data it will show an alert .
